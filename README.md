# python-final-project
For my final project I decided to look at top video game sales. I decided to use this dataset becasue I like video game.
A few things I was looking for is have sales been going up over the years? What publisher has sold the most? What are the differances between north america sales and global sales?
The first thing I did was look for missing values and duplicates.
There was missing values in the year and Publisher columns.
I was able to fill in the missing publisher with unknown.
I did drop all of the rows with a missing year.
After that I looked to see if there were any duplicates in the name column and there was not.
After cleaning the data I started doing data manipulation and analysis.
I started by looking at publishers. The publisher with the most games on the list is Electronic Arts, but when you look at which publisher made the most money it is Nintendo.
I created a new data frame that only had the North American sales. The biggest differences between global sales and North American sales was Duck Hunt being the 3rd highest game in North America and Mario Kart Wii dropping to 5th.
Actions games sold the most.
